## Overview

### The challenge

A solution to day 12 of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp" course.
The challenge was to create a console game where the computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100.
The player can choose between 2 levels: 'easy' and 'hard', and get 10 or 5 guesses.
The goal of the game is for the player to guess the number before the guesses run out.

## My process

### Built with

- Python

### What I learned

This project was fairly easy.
I did stumble a bit while creating the game logic, with the loops and conditionals.


### Continued development

I need more practice in procedural programming, and I need to start getting comfortable with OOP.
